# Assessing Earth-Like Exoplanets: An Unsupervised Learning Approach

## Project Overview and Goals

This project aims to assess Earth-like exoplanets through an unsupervised learning approach. The primary goal is to group or cluster planets based on similar features, such as:

- Distance from their host stars
- Orbital period
- Mass
- Equilibrium temperature
- Eccentricity

By analyzing these characteristics, I aim to identify planets that exhibit similarities to Earth.
